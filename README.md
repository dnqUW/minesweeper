Bao Thinh Diep Solution:
	. Use the Main.java to run the program
	. The program was designed based on MVC model. The Model is the "MineField" class, the Controller is the "Controller" class 
	  and the View is the "Main" class.
Mat Belmont Solution:
	. Classpath might be wonky so run like:
	. java -cp ./bin model.Minesweeper
